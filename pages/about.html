              <h2>The Journey of Transformation:</h2>
              <h2>From Parties to Pixels</h2>
              <p>
                Hi, I'm Sofía, the founder of TechLove. A few years ago, I was just another teenager with no plans and a love for partying. But then the pandemic hit, and my life took an unexpected turn. With the support of my father, who saw my potential in math, I turned to YouTube tutorials to deepen my understanding of the subject. This was my introduction to the world of online learning—a world that could bring first class education to my living room halfway across the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the pandemic slowly ended and my plans for a summer of beach techno parties got disrupted by its lingering effects, I ventured into the world of modeling. It was a peculiar industry, deeply impacted by the digital transformation—models competing with influencers, politics affecting fashion, and marketing evolving into clickbait reels.
              </p>
              <p>Disenchanted with the superficiality of that world, I found peace in coding. In this new digital community, I discovered a sense of purpose and an opportunity to grow, both as a coder and as a human being. Inspired by visionaries, I realized the importance of engineering. Unfortunately, the traditional education system wouldn't have me; I didn't fit into their mold.</p>
              <p>
                That's when I decided to carve out my own path. Armed with online courses, certifications, and tools like ChatGPT, I began my self-learning journey. And now, I want to share all my favorite resources with you, through TechLove.
              </p>
